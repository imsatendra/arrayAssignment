1. Selecting odd numbers - Given a list of numbers, select the ones that are odd.

2. Selecting even numbers - Given a list of numbers, select the ones that are even.

3. Sum of a list of numbers - Given a list of numbers, find the sum of all these numbers.

4. Printing reverse - Given a list of numbers, PRINT the list in reverse order.

5. Selecting every second element - Given a list of numbers, select every second one.
[1,2,5,-1,2,4,3,1] => 1,5,2,3

6. Reverse Fibonacci - Generate a fibonacci sequence of length n in reverse order.
fiboReverse(8) => [13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0]

7. Greatest number in a list - Given a list of numbers, find the greatest number in that sequence.
[1,26,3,5] => 26

8. Lowest number in a list - Given a list of numbers, find the lowest number in that sequence.
[26,3,1,5] => 1

9. Average of a list - Given a list of numbers, find the average of that list.

10. Mapping lengths - Given a list of names, generate another array that contains the length of
each of the names.
["mary","had","a","little","lamb"] => [4, 3, 1, 6, 4]

11. Counting odd numbers - Write a function to count how many odd numbers are present in an array.

12. Counting even numbers - Write a function to count how many even numbers are present in an array.
countNumbersAbove([3,4,5,6,1],4) => 2

13. Count how many numbers above a certain threshold in an array.
countNumbersAbove([3,4,5,6,1],4) => 2

14. Count how many numbers below a certain threshold in an array.

15. Reversing an Array - Given an array, write a function that provides a reversed version of
the same array *without* changing the contents of the original array.

16. Index Of a Number - Given an array of numbers find the first position of a specified number.

17. Ascending order - Given an array of numbers, check if the array is in ascending order.

18. Descending order - Given an array of numbers, check if the array is in descending order.

19. Extract digits - Given a number, extract the digits of a number into an array.
extract(20345) => [2,0,3,4,5]

20. Unique - Given an array, remove duplicate elements and return an array of only unique elements.

21. Union - Given two arrays, generate a new array consisting of unique elements across both
those arrays.

22. Intersection - Given two arrays, generate a new array consisting of unique elements that
are contained in both arrays.

23. Difference - Given two arrays, generate a new array that consists of unique elements that
are present in the first array, but not in the second.

24. isSubset - Given two arrays, check if the second is a proper subset of the first.

25. Zip - insert elements from two arrays as follows:
let a = [1,2,3]
let b = [4,5,6]
zip(a,b) => [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
There must be only as many elements as the shorter array.
let a = [1,2,3]
let b = [4,5,]
zip(a,b) => [[1,4],[2,5]]

26. Rotate - creates a new array by rotating elements from the given array.
rotate([1,2,3,4,5],2) => [3,4,5,1,2]
rotate([1,2,3,4,5],5) => [5,1,2,3,4]

27. Partition - Given an array of numbers, it returns a partitioned array consisting of
numbers above a certain number and below a certain number.
partition([1,2,7,4,9,10,5],5) => [[1,2,4,5], [7,9,10]]
